Model data:

y:  expected demand in one location around one shell station
x1: sum(battery status of empty vehicles (< 33%))
x2:  sum(  (battery status of nearest vehicles) - battery status of empty vehicles (< 33%))
x3   weekday_flag ( No: 1 or Yes: 2)
x4   Peak_hour_flag (No: 1 or Yes: 2)
x5   temperature_cold_flag (No: 1 or Yes: 2)
x6   Competitor_Near_Station_Flag (Yes: 1 or No: 2)
x7:  No of vehicles with less battery
x8:  No of vehicles with good battery status.


For Model training:

In real time: To use real time data once demand data if available.
For simulation:  

             y =    x1 * (x1/x2) * (x3/2) *  (x4/2)  * (x5/2) * (x6/2) 

 example:  x1: 30 KW
           x2: 40 KW  (77-33)  capacity= 100
           X3: 2
           x4: 2
           x5: 1
           x6: 1

            y =  30* (30/40)* (2/2) * (2/2) * (1/2) * (1/2) = 5.6 KW

Data agggregation1:
                
1. Merge electric vehicle data & station data based on city.
2. calculate the distance between each vehicle and charging station.
3. sort the data based on city & vehicleid
4. keep the minimum distance data for each city & vehicleid
5. create & update the weekday flag logic (! 0 or 6)
6. create & update the temperature cold flag logic (<=15)
7. calculate the battery remaining status of each vehicle
8. calculate the power required status of each vehicle.


Data agggregation2 (Based on aggregation 1):

1. Aggregate the data based on charging station id & point_in_time. (Avg of temp, sum of battery pending, sum of power required, avg of distance)
2. Outer join the data with shell charging stations to bring in Competitor_Near_Station_Flag



Model Build (based data aggregation 2)

1. Create y data based on formula.
2. Take data for 5 cities.
3. Build python based regression model.
4. Save the model and test with remaining 2 cities data and validate.
